AI-Driven Weather Forecasting for Renewable-Powered Data Centers: A Comparative Feasibility Study of Wind and Solar Regions

As data centers are increasing in demand, so are their carbon emissions. Therefore, the reliance of data centers on renewable energy is essential for meeting climate targets. This paper investigates how machine learning-based weather forecasting can inform data center site selection by improving the predictability of renewable energy availability. Using historical weather data from 2024, we apply a time-series forecasting algorithm to simulate 2025 solar irradiance and wind speeds in two distinct regionsâ€”Arizona (solar-dominant) and West Virginia (wind-dominant). These forecasts are translated into expected energy output using physics-based conversion models, and then evaluated through a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of forecast accuracy on energy supply reliability, carbon emissions from grid fallback, and return on investment.

We hypothesize that machine learning-based weather forecasting can significantly improve the feasibility and carbon efficiency of renewable-powered data centers by enabling more accurate predictions of wind and solar energy availability, with varying sensitivity across different geographic regions.
