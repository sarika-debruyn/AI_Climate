AI-Driven Weather Forecasting for Renewable-Powered Data Centers: A Comparative Feasibility Study of Wind and Solar Regions

As data centers are increasing in demand, so are their carbon emissions. Therefore, the reliance of data centers on renewable energy is essential for meeting climate targets. This project explores how forecast accuracy and uncertainty impact the performance of solar- and wind-powered data centers equipped with battery storage. I use two case studies—solar generation in Arizona and wind generation in West Virginia—using next-day forecasts to drive tje dispatch model, which balances on-site renewables, battery charging/discharging, and minimal grid fallback under a time-varying demand profile. I compare three forecasting methods—a climatology baseline, NGBoost (probabilistic gradient boosting), and TabPFN (neural probabilistic tabular model)—each providing deterministic or distributional predictions that inform the scheduling decisions. By integrating battery storage, I aim to realistically capture temporal shifting and storage inefficiencies.

I build my analysis on publicly available meteorological datasets from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and the NREL WIND Toolkit. Using these sources, I quantify how forecast accuracy and uncertainty translate into reductions in grid dependency, carbon emissions, and operational costs. Our results demonstrate the tangible benefits of AI-driven forecasting for enhancing the reliability and sustainability of renewable-powered data centers.
