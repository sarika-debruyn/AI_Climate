## Assumptions

### Geographic Locations:
We need to choose the USA cities that isolate solar and wind as dominant energy sources while also ensuring that the renewable resource in each location is plentiful, consistent, and well-documented. 
1. **Solar Energy:** Yuma, Arizona, was selected as the solar-dominant site in this study due to its exceptional solar resource profile and infrastructure feasibility. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Yuma receives an average annual Global Horizontal Irradiance of over 6.5 kWh/m¬≤/day, placing it among the highest in the continental United States [1]. The city experiences approximately 4,000 hours of sunshine per year, earning recognition by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) as the sunniest city in the U.S. [2]. This makes Yuma an ideal location for testing the effectiveness of machine learning-based solar forecasting models, as it offers a consistent and abundant solar resource baseline.

3. **Wind energy:** Mount Storm, West Virginia, was selected as the wind-dominant site for this study due to its strong, consistent wind resources and existing large-scale wind energy infrastructure. It is home to the Mount Storm Wind Farm, a 264 MW facility consisting of 132 turbines spread across 12 miles [3]. This makes it one of the largest wind energy installations in the eastern United States. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the region experiences average wind speeds of 7.5 to 8.5 m/s at 100 meters above ground level‚Äîwell above the threshold for utility-scale wind generation [4]. Furthermore, the site is integrated into the Eastern Interconnection grid, ensuring transmission access and operational relevance. Its combination of real-world deployment, strong wind resource, and available historical weather data makes Mount Storm an ideal case study for evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning-based wind forecasting in renewable-powered data center planning.

### Solar Farm Size characteristics:
To model the output of our solar forecast models at a realistic scale, we assume a **40 MW utility-scale solar farm**. This assumption aligns with standard practices and data center peak load matching. Based on industry and government sources, the following parameters were used:

- **Panel Area per Unit**: 1.6 m¬≤  
- **Efficiency**: 20%  
- **Estimated Panel Count**: 160,000  
- **Total Panel Area**: 256,000 m¬≤  
- **Land Area per MW**: 2.5‚Äì4 acres (~10,117 to 16,187 m¬≤)

### Data center characteristics:
We are testing for forecast variability so we need to isolate for other variables.
1. The data center has a dynamic demand. We use the following time-varying model:
   D(t) = (C + Vc X h(t) x d(t) x s(t)) x œµ(t)
   D(t): demand at time t (MW)
   C: constant base load (MW)
   Vc: Max variable load (MW)
   h(t): Hourly profile (0-1)
   d(t): day of week adjustment
   s(t): seasonal adjustment
   œµ(t): random noise

   * We model seasonal variation in data center demand using multipliers of $s(t) = 1.1$ for summer, $0.95$ for winter, and $1.0$ for spring and fall, based on the observed increase in cooling-related energy use reported by Shehabi et al. (8). To represent random variation in demand, we include a noise term $\epsilon(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(1.0, 0.05)$, following the forecast uncertainty range suggested by Qiu et al. (9).

   
3. Operates 24/7, 365 days a year, with no demand-side flexibility
4. All electricity is intended to be supplied by on-site renewable infrastructure 
5. When renewable output is insufficient, the center draws from the local power grid.

To model a large-scale data center powered by renewable energy, we assume a **peak power demand of 40 MW**. This assumption aligns with the infrastructure scale of regional commercial or hyperscale data centers commonly used by cloud providers. Based on average server power draw and Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) benchmarks, we estimate the number of servers and power distribution as follows:

- **Peak Total Power**: 40 MW  
- **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)**: 1.33  
- **Power per Server**: 500 W (0.5 kW)
- **IT Load** = 40 MW / 1.33 ‚âà **30.08 MW**
- **Estimated Servers** = 30.08 MW / 0.5 kW ‚âà **60,160 servers**
- **Non-IT Load** (cooling, lighting, etc.) ‚âà **10 MW**

These values reflect current trends in data center design. According to the Uptime Institute's 2024 Global Survey:
- The **average PUE across all data centers is 1.56**, with newer, more efficient builds achieving **PUEs of 1.3 or better**.
- **Server rack densities** remain mostly under 8 kW, supporting the per-server power assumption.
- Industry trends indicate increasing infrastructure densification driven by high-performance computing and business applications.

### Battery-System Storage Infrastructure:
To model a battery storage system that supports a large-scale renewable-powered data center, we assume a lithium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS) with a usable capacity of 40 MWh. This assumption aligns with the requirements of hyperscale data centers with a peak load of 40 MW, offering approximately one hour of full-load backup or longer partial-load operation. Based on current deployment standards and energy storage best practices, we estimate the system parameters as follows:

- **Battery Chemistry**: Lithium-Ion
- **Total Capacity**: 50 MWh
- **Depth of Discharge (DoD)**: 80%
- **Usable Capacity** = 50 MWh √ó 0.80 = 40 MWh
- **Round-Trip Efficiency (RTE)**: 92.5%
- **Minimum State of Charge (SoC)**: 10%
- **Maximum State of Charge (SoC)**: 90%
- **Effective Operating SoC Range**: 80%

Charge/discharge behavior is defined as follows:
- Batteries charge when on-site renewable generation exceeds the data center‚Äôs load.
- Batteries discharge when demand exceeds available renewable power, helping prevent grid fallback.
- All charging and discharging cycles account for round-trip efficiency losses.
- These values reflect current best practices in BESS design for high-performance infrastructure. According to energy modeling reports from NREL and E3:
- Li-ion batteries typically operate at 90‚Äì95% round-trip efficiency, depending on degradation, temperature, and usage rate.
- SoC limits (10‚Äì90%) and 80% DoD are widely adopted to extend battery lifespan and avoid performance loss.
- This capacity ensures 1 hour of autonomy at peak demand or multi-hour buffering for variable loads.

### Renewable Energy Infrastructure:
We need a baseline conversion from weather to power in order to assess how ML forecast quality affects power output, ensuring consistency across geographies. The data centers have a fixed number of wind turbines or solar panels sized to match peak production under optimal conditions.
1. For solar energy (Arizona):
- We assume a solar panel efficiency of 20% and a performance ratio of 0.8, values consistent with well-designed PV systems in high-irradiance regions such as Arizona [5]
- Orientation and tilt optimized for local latitude

2. For wind energy (West Virginia):
- Wind turbine efficiency = 45%
- Turbine height = 100m
- Air density = 1.225 kg/m¬≥ (standard)
- Power output is modeled using a standard turbine power curve

### Power Conversion:
1. Solar: P = A x r x H X PR
A: panel area (normalized to meet 10 MW peak)
r: efficiency (20%)
H: solar irradiance (W/m¬≤)
PR: performance ratio (0.8)

2. Wind: P= 0.5 x œÅ √ó A x v^3 x n
œÅ: air density (1.225 kg/m¬≥)
A: rotor swept area
v: wind speed (m/s)
Œ∑: turbine efficiency (45%)

### Economic Conversion:
- Cost of electricity from solar: $0.04‚Äì$0.045/kWh [6]
- Cost of electricity from wind: $0.03‚Äì$0.035/kWh [6]
- Cost of grid electricity: $0.13/kWh [7]
