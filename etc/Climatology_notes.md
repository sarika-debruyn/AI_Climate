We begin by evaluating a climatology-based model that forecasts solar power availability using the historical average GHI by hour and month. This model assumes a consistent seasonal pattern and serves as a baseline for comparison against more complex ML models. We assess the model’s performance in terms of both availability (total predicted energy over time) and reliability (forecast error and deviation from actual values)
