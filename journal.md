### Goals
- April 18th: Finish Climatology model for solar and wind

### Blockers / Challenges

### Things to do:
- find values for time-varying model
- add assumptions for battery system
- add wind turbine assumptions from baseline model

### Notes/Questions
Ask professor: 
- Can we assume hypothetical data centers in West Virginia and Arizona but do we need to use real operational data?
- Is it okay if our cost of electricity from solar and wind is fixed and not dynamically based on the market?
- accounting for PPAs
